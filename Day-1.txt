Today, let's start with the first topic of Python  Challenge:

Variables & Data Types


What is a variable?

Think of a variable as a label on a container that holds some data. You create a variable by giving it a name and putting a value inside.

In Python, it looks like this:

name = "Aaaru"
age = 25
height = 5.9
is_student = True

- name holds text (called a string) — notice the quotes!

- age holds a whole number (integer)

- height holds a decimal number (float)

- is_student holds a True/False value (boolean)

You can check a variable’s type using type():

print(type(name))    # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))     # <class 'int'>


Why use variables?

They let you store information so your program can remember it and use it later — like a player's score or your name.

Valid Variable Names

Python has some rules for naming variables:

✅ Must start with a letter or underscore
✅ Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
❌ Cannot start with a number
❌ Cannot use Python’s built-in keywords like if, while, class, etc.

Examples:

user_name = "Amit"   # valid
_user2 = "Riya"      # valid
2nd_user = "Error!"  # ❌ Invalid: starts with number


Let’s build a small project!

We’ll write a simple program that asks for your name, age, and favorite hobby, then prints a fun personalized message.

Here’s the full code:

# Ask the user for their name and save it in a variable
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Ask for their age and save it
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Ask for their favorite hobby and save it
hobby = input("What's your favorite hobby? ")

# Print a personalized message using the info collected
print(f"Hey {name}! So you’re {age} years old and love {hobby}. That’s awesome!")

How this works:

input() waits for you to type something and press Enter — whatever you type gets saved in the variable.

print() shows a message on the screen.

The f"" means you can include variables inside the message for personalization.
