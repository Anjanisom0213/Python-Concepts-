Topic - Lists & Tuples

ðŸ”¹ What is a List? 

A list is a mutable (changeable) collection of items in a specific order.

Syntax:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruits[0])    # Output: apple

fruits.append("mango") 

print(fruits)        # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']

âœ… You can add, remove, or update elements in a list.


ðŸ”¸ What is a Tuple? 

A tuple is similar to a list, but it's immutable (unchangeable once defined).

Syntax:

colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors[1])     # Output: green

ðŸ”’ You cannot modify, append, or remove elements from a tuple after creation.


âœ… Key Differences:

Mutability:

- List: Mutable â€” you can change, add, or remove elements after creation.
- Tuple: Immutable â€” once defined, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.


Syntax:

- List: Use square brackets â†’ []

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

- Tuple: Use round brackets â†’ ()

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)


Use Case:

- List: Use when you need to modify the collection later.

- Tuple: Use when the data should remain constant or to ensure integrity.

Performance:

Tuple is slightly faster than List due to immutability and fixed size.
