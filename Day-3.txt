A string is a sequence of characters inside quotes. You can use:

name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello!'
paragraph = """This is
a multiline string."""

ðŸ‘‰ Strings are immutable â€” once created, they can't be changed directly.


âœ¨ Common String Methods

Here are some useful methods youâ€™ll use all the time:

lower() â†’ makes everything lowercase

upper() â†’ makes everything uppercase

strip() â†’ removes spaces from start and end

replace("old", "new") â†’ replaces parts of a string

split() â†’ splits text into a list of words

count("word") â†’ counts how many times something appears

find("word") â†’ finds the position of a word

startswith("Hello") â†’ checks how a string begins

endswith("world") â†’ checks how a string ends


ðŸ§ª Examples

msg = "  Python is Awesome!  "

print(msg.lower())        # python is awesome!
print(msg.strip())        # Python is Awesome!
print(msg.replace("Awesome", "Powerful"))  # Python is Powerful!
print(msg.split())        # ['Python', 'is', 'Awesome!']
