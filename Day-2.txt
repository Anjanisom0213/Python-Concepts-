Day 2 

Topic - Operators in Python

Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.

Types of Operators in Python:

1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for basic math:
+ (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), // (floor divide), % (modulus), ** (power)

a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)   # 13
print(a ** b)  # 1000


2. Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values:
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

x = 5
print(x == 5)  # True
print(x != 3)  # True


3. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditional statements:
and, or, not

age = 20
print(age > 18 and age < 25)  # True


4. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.

score = 10
score += 5   # score is now 15


Mini Project: Build a Simple Calculator

Task: Build a calculator that asks the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then prints the result.

Approach

1. Take two numbers from the user.
2. Ask for an operator (+, -, *, /).
3. Perform the operation based on what the user entered.
4. Print the result, or shows "Invalid operator!" if the input is wrong.
